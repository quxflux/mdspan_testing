# mdspan_testing

A small test project to explore the [`std::mdspan` C++ library feature](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/mdspan) coming up with C++23.

## notes

As there is no `std::mdspan` implementation available in the major `std::` library implementations at the time of this writing, this project uses the [kokkos `mdspan` reference implementation](https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan).
